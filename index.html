                <h3>Tale of the Family</h3>
                <p>
                    In a time when magic is a sin and users that could wield magic were casted-out as monsters, if the
                    only person that gave you warmth and light was dragged into the depths of Hell, would you find a way
                    to save that person?
                    Driven by familial love, Leif lost his parents at a young age. Left with only his sister, Jade, Leif
                    took care of her as she practiced magic growing up, only to be shunned by their very own village.
                    Taking refuge in a cabin in the forest, Leif and Jade sought a peaceful life there. But what trials
                    lie ahead of the siblings when Jade opens the Gate to Hell and is dragged in against her will?
                    Having lost everything he once had, Leif journeys into Hell to save his one and only sister.

                            Join Leif in his endeavor to save his sister in a challenging 2D roguelike game. Leif wields
                            magic bullets to hone down his enemies, but deep within the culture of "Every man for
                            himself"
                            in Hell, what else will he learn?

                        than a peaceful life with her. In order to fulfill this wish, he journeys into Hell to save
                        Jade.

                        little did she know that her struggles would change her inside-out.
