            In a time when magic is a sin and users that could wield magic were casted-out as monsters, if the only
            person that gave you warmth and light was dragged into the depths of Hell, would you find a way to save that
            person?<br><br>

            Driven by familial love, Leif lost his parents at a young age. Left with only his sister, Jade, Leif took
            care of her as she practiced magic growing up, only to be shunned by their very own village.<br><br>

            Taking refuge in a cabin in the forest, Leif and Jade sought a peaceful life there. But what trials lie
            ahead the siblings when Jade opens the Gate to Hell and was dragged in against her will? In Hell, there is
            no peace, and every inhabitant almost lived in a manner of “every man for himself.” On Earth, there may be
            strife and struggles, but it is not uncommon to see people working together to overcome these hardships but
            such a concept did not exist in Hell. There is no peace, and there is no rest.<br><br>

            Having lost everything he once had, Leif journeys into Hell to save his one and only sister, but should he
            find his sister, will she be the same person he once knew?

                    Leif is a young boy who grew up with his parents in a time of war, strife, and famine. However, he
                    lost his father at a young age, and not too long after his sister, Jade, was born, he lost his
                    mother as well. Left with only his sister, Leif sought to raise her and asked for nothing more than
                    a peaceful life with her. In order to fulfill this wish, he journeys into Hell to save Jade.
